# fahrenheit-to-celsius-converter
This fahrenheit to celsius converter converts fahrenheit to celsius and vice versa

This is python though, not exe! But this github repo is the source code for <a href="https://roperdofazir.itch.io/celsius-to-farenheit-converter" target="_blank">this itch.io project which is .exe</a> so how is it a python file?

Well I just followed <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71021810/convert-py-to-exe-with-cmd" target="_blank">these instructions</a>.

That is the end of the devlog on 1/28/2023
